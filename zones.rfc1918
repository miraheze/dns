/*
 * How to add new zones:
 * 1. Create a zonefile for it with all the records you want in `/zones/`.
 * 2. Add a zone block for it here, like so:
 *  zone "miraheze.org" { type master; file "/etc/bind/zones/miraheze.org"; };
 * 3. Commit and push.
 * We don't use zone transfers because Puppet will already download the zonefile to all nameservers; they can both think they're masters, no problem.
